# FlexFolio Project Documentation

## Overview
FlexFolio is a versatile and customizable portfolio template designed to showcase professional work across multiple fields. Built with TailwindCSS on a flexible HTML/CSS/JS structure, it is adaptable for portfolios, business services, eCommerce sites, blogs, and landing pages.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js and npm (https://nodejs.org/)
- Git (https://git-scm.com/)
- Visual Studio Code or any preferred code editor (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## 1. Setting Up Your Development Environment

### 1-01. Install Visual Studio Code
Download and install Visual Studio Code from the [official site](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### 1-02. Install Node.js and npm
Visit the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download and install the latest version of Node.js, which includes npm. This is required to manage the project dependencies.

### 1-03. Install Git
Download and install Git from [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/) to manage version control for this project.

## 2. Creating and Cloning the GitHub Repository

### 2-01. Create a New Repository on GitHub
Go to GitHub and create a new repository for your project. Name it `flexfolio` and initialize it with a README if you prefer. Do not initialize with a .gitignore or license; you will handle this manually later.

### 2-02. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want your project to reside. Then run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flexfolio.git
cd flexfolio
```
This clones the repository into a local folder named `flexfolio` and changes into that directory.

## 3. Configuring the Project

### 3-01. Set Up Your Project Structure
Create the necessary folders and files for your project within the cloned repository:
```bash
mkdir src dist
touch src/index.html src/styles.css src/index.js
```

### 3-02. Install Project Dependencies
Webpack will be used as the build tool, and TailwindCSS will be used for styling.

#### Webpack and Related Plugins
```bash
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin
```

#### TailwindCSS and its dependencies
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
npx tailwindcss init
```

#### Set up PostCSS
Create a `postcss.config.js` in the root directory:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require('tailwindcss'),
    require('autoprefixer'),
  ],
}
```

### 3-03. Configure Webpack
Create a `webpack.config.js` file in the root directory with the following basic configuration:
```javascript
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'bundle.js'
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: './src/index.html'
    })
  ],
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader', 'postcss-loader']
      },
      {
        test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: ['babel-loader']
      }
    ]
  },
  devServer: {
    static: {
      directory: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),
    },
    open: true
  }
};
```

### 3-04. Set Up Tailwind in your CSS
Add the following lines to your `src/styles.css` to include Tailwind:
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

## 4. Building the Project

### 4-01. Running the Build
Run Webpack to build your project:
```bash
npx webpack --mode development
```

### 4-02. Watch for Changes
To have Webpack watch changes and rebuild automatically:
```bash
npx webpack --watch
```

### 4-03. Start the Development Server
To start a local development server that opens your project in the browser and reloads on changes:
```bash
npx webpack serve
```

## 5. Version Control with Git

### 5-01. Stage Changes
Stage your changes for commit:
```bash
git add .
```

### 5-02. Commit Changes
Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
```bash
git commit -m "Initial project setup with TailwindCSS and Webpack"
```

### 5-03. Push Changes
Push your changes back to GitHub:
```bash
git push origin main
```

## Conclusion
This README provides a comprehensive guide to setting up, developing, and deploying the FlexFolio project with a focus on future scalability for React and CMS integration.
